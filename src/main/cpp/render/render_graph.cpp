     * \brief Adds all the passes that `pass_name` depends on to the list of ordered passes
     *
     * This method performs a depth-first traversal of the pass tree. It shouldn't matter whether we do depth or
     * breadth first, but depth first feels cleaner
     *
     * \param pass_name The passes that were just added to the list of ordered passes
     * \param passes A map from pass name to pass. Useful for the explicit dependencies of a pass
     * \param ordered_passes The passes in submissions order... almost. When this function adds to ordered_passes the
     * list has a lot of duplicates. They're removed in a later step
     * \param resource_to_write_pass A map from resource name to list of passes that write to that resource. Useful for
     * resolving the implicit dependencies of a pass
     * \param depth The depth in the tree that we're at. If this number ever grows bigger than the total number of
     * passes, there's a circular dependency somewhere in the render graph. This is Bad and we hate it
