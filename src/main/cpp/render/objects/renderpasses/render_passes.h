         *      - Always has a format of R8G8B8A8
         *      - Can only be used as a pass's input
         * - NormalVirtualTexture
         *      - Virtual texture atlas that holds normal textures
         *      - Textures which have `_n` after the name requested by Minecraft are in this atlas
         *      - If no normal texture exists for a given object, a texture with RGBA of (0, 0, 1, 1) is used
         *      - Always has a format of R8G8B8A8
         *      - Can only be used as a pass's input
         * - DataVirtualTexture
         *      - Virtual texture atlas that holds data textures
         *      - Textures which have a `_s` after the name requested by Minecraft are in this atlas
         *      - If no data texture exists for a given object, a texture with an RGBA of (0, 0, 0, 0) is used
         *      - Always has a format of R8G8B8A8
         *      - Can only be used as a pass's input
         * - Lightmap
         *      - Lightmap, loaded from the current resourcepack
         *      - Format of RGB8
         *      - Can only be used as an input
         * - Backbuffer
         *      - The texture that gets presented to the screen
         *      - Always has a format of RGB8
         *      - Can only be used as a pass's output
         *
         * If you use one of the virtual textures, then all fields except the binding are ignored

     * change per frame, a UBO for per-model data like the model matrix, and the virtual texture atlases. The default
