This folder has all the models for Nova. "Model" in this context refers 
to the data that Nova deals with. This includes Entity and Chunk 
definitions, Textures, Shaders and Geometry Buffers, and the rendering
Settings. Additionally, the Model encompasses loading the textures,
shaders, and (eventually) block and entity geometry, as well as packing
all this data into a format that is useful to the renderer
